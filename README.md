O Livro dos Fados
=================

Scores for traditional fados in «O Livro dos Fados» book.

Several kinds of scores are published in this repository:

 * For each fado there is a file named `universal.md` presenting a _score_ for
   the fado in [universal key notation](Notation.md).
 * Lilypond versions in lead sheet format are expected for each fado.
 * Guitar arrangements will also be published.
 * Other versions will be hopefully provided in the future.
