Fado scores
===========

Scores for traditional fados.

Several kinds of scores are published in this repository:

 * There is a [data base](Database) presenting a _score_ for
   the harmonic analysis of all fados in [universal key notation](Notation.md). 
 * Lilypond versions in several formats are expected for each fado: lead sheet,
   guitar arrangement (also in tablature notation) and rhytmic staff version for
   the harmonic analysis.

The scores for the fados in PDF format are available to
[download](https://sites.google.com/site/fadoscores/scores).
